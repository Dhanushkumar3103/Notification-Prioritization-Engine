# Fallback & Monitoring

## Fallback Strategy

If AI or external service fails:

- Switch to rule-based engine
- Deliver critical alerts immediately
- Queue events for retry
- Log failures for review

## Monitoring Metrics

- Decision latency
- Sent vs suppressed ratio
- Duplicate detection rate
- Queue backlog size
- System uptime

## Alerts

- High suppression anomaly
- Latency spike
- Service downtime
